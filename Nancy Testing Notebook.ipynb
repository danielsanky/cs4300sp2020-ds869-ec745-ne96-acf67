At approximately 7:30pm her car was involved in a single car, non life threatening accident at a hairpin turn on the dark and desolate Route 112. The few witnesses who spoke with police said she denied their assistance. She was gone without a trace before the police showed up approximately ten minutes later. She has never been seen or heard from since. Now two filmmakers set out to make a documentary and find answers on this mystery by diving deep into Maura\\'s life, the region in which she went missing, and the online world of armchair detectives.

Of course she anticipates ‘converting’ many omnivores, however she also looks forward to supporting animal causes and charities, organizing events and meetups, and encouraging a more active and PROactive vegan community in her vicinity and far beyond.\\nFrom an outspoken and realistic standpoint, Erin addresses and educates on a number of topics ranging from Veganism 101, to animal rights and abolition, to health and fitness, to environmentalism, to cooking, baking, and more. Red Radio regularly welcomes guests from the activist community along with music, television and film personalities, and will occasionally record on location at vegan hotspots, interview vegan ‘celebrities’ and include real stories with vegans of all walks of life. Erin Red's goals are to educate, entertain, and enforce. To wake people up.

Well’s similarly powerful perspective on social and political development as portrayed in his novel \"The Time Machine,\" are just a few examples. \\nThis seminar examines the role of science fiction as a powerful vehicle for social and political commentary, especially as it relates to the evolutionary tendencies of human societies.',\n",

It’s an unfortunate truth, but “The Guru Party,” made up of the trainers, brokers & endless supply of coaches—and what they teach—are the architects responsible for bankrupting the real estate industry of trust. Because of them. The term “real estate agent,” in the eyes of society, has become a stain on your reputation. This podcast is the solution. As you know, I’ve been blessed. I’ve had so many wonderful things happen to me. And I’ve made wonderful things happen by virtue of the opportunities available to me, and by “seeing” the clearing through the fog. The Guru Party’s message, though, is that you must hunt and beg and demean yourself in a variety of “standard” ways to be successful in real estate. Like, “Prospecting is your job.” I reject that. The spirit of the Entrepreneur knows no limits. It would be shameful to waste it on prospecting. An activity of such low-status. To rise to new heights, though, you must understand the truths that enable you to defy “the gravity” that others tell you cannot be escaped. They are wrong. Their ‘lack of skills’ and ‘limited ambition’ blinds them to what is possible. This podcast, undoubtedly, will infuriate The Guru Party. They will reject it. That’s Ok. By the majority of low-information agents too, it will be rejected. Again, that's OK… because in time, after enough pain is experienced and suffered, enough struggle is endured, enough frustration is dealt with—they will come around. They will smarten up. They will wise up. They will realize The Guru's Party's approach has failed them for fundamental reasons. And they will stop trying to deny or outflank the reality of the truths presented on this podcast. They are, after all, undeniable…truths. For more, visit: www.FightTheGuruParty.com\",\n",
